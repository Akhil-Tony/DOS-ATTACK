The one-slope model is a simplified path loss model used to estimate signal attenuation in wireless communication systems. It assumes a uniform loss rate over a given distance and does not account for specific environmental factors or variations in signal propagation.

In the one-slope model, the path loss is calculated using the following formula:

PL=PL0+10⋅n⋅log⁡10(d/d0)PL=PL0​+10⋅n⋅log10​(d/d0​)

Where:

    PLPL is the path loss in decibels (dB)
    PL0PL0​ is the reference path loss at a reference distance d0d0​ (usually 1 meter) in dB
    nn is the path loss exponent or slope of the decay (typically ranging from 2 to 4)
    dd is the distance between the transmitter and receiver

The one-slope model assumes that the path loss increases linearly with the logarithm of the distance. The path loss exponent (nn) represents the rate at which the signal strength decreases with distance. A higher nn value indicates a faster decay in signal strength over distance.
